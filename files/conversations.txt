Come on, witch! Loose your fires!
This is a reprieve, witch. Judgement awaits you still.
Talk to the Wizard then, Dwarf.
Right. If you'd like, I can offer a few pointers, about you know, storytelling, later.  
Guess word get around.
Indeed, but I did not come here willingly. 
Sorry. I've never been this close to an elf before. Fought on the same field as a few, but that's all.
There is madness enough in the Empire, without these ratmen.
Ah, but your quest may end someday. You might find Karak Zorn. My burden shall never fade.
What brings you here, Elf? I demand to know. 
Nothing personal, Wizard. It's just... you're a wizard. 
You're not alone, Sergeant. 
By you? I think not.
Scrutinize all you want, One-Eye. Your kind will never find the sunlight flickering through the canopy.
How do you mean?
Why do you fear confinement so?
A hand is of no help if it is raised against me.
You are as much a danger to us as you are to the vermin, witch.
It'll be ours again, Wutelgi. You wait and see.
Eh, No comment. Why don't you just go kill some vermin, Elf.
Thanks, I'll remember this, Azumgi
You know, he had nothing to do with my investigation.
A Taal-blessed blade will serve me well enough.
Trust me with yours, a moment - I want to show you something, dwarf.
�If� the trial was now, I'd tell the magistrate to kill some bloody rat-men, and not prattle about you. 
Yeah, timed it perfectly too, just when you and the rat-men arrived. Bloody fantastic. 
I'm not an imbecile. I've learned when to speak.
You're an abomination, witch.
Keep him away from the next one, mayflies. I've no desire to die in a blackfire explosion.
Indeed, it has.
Oh, don't you worry about my revenge, sir. 
I didn't think the Order cared about the rat-men.
You follow Taal, Sergeant.  Not so common in these parts, no?
Your shackles can easily be restored, witch.
Any success with the interrogations, sir?
I met one like you before.
I've never been as far as Estalia, pyromancer. What's it like?
Sigmar protects only the worthy.
..is where I am from, alright?
Consider this an opportunity to prove your righteousness, witch.
Be more careful, Goreksson...
My questions have led me here, and I'm not leaving until I have my answers.
Well, cease it immediately. My patience is wearing thin. 
For starters. No one makes a fool of me, Wutelgi.
For once, you have a point. 
Did you hear about Kislev? They say it's overrun by northlanders.
Takes some skill, missing all of them like that!
You don't sound worried - I thought your realms were allies.
No it doesnt, just like you and those shackles, I suppose!
Then why tell me?
I don't seek your approval, dwarf. Duty is its own reward.
It was a shot blessed by Sigmar himself.
It isn't magic I fear, but the corruption that comes with it.
Impossible! I feel the strength of my ancestors flowing through me!
Yes sir, but he started up again in a cleaner, blander area, you could say. 
Any news of your kin, Kruber?
Sir...
Yes, what of it?
Wot? Nothing simple about it
Aye dawri, many times. They're like flies around dung.
Whereas amongst mine, it's considered a curse.
Have you travelled far, elf?
You think he cares about innocence?
Kruber, you know very well there was no time for an excursion to your family farm.
Listen,  Kerillian, I don't mean to pry...
Always know your enemy, Fire Wizard. 
Right as always, Bardin.
And what's to stop me from killing you, and fleeing into the night?
Come on, thaggoraki! Will none of you brave my steel?
Wise fellow, Sigmar.  Now come on, don't be shy. 
Aye, well watch that Saltzpyre doesn't wring your neck. He might have the mood for it still.
Yes. It's called Innocence.
Don't lecture me, Goreksson!
But that doesn't stop you does it? 
Blindness is about more than sight. Fear closed his mind long ago.
Argue another time. Do you want to bring the vermin down on us?
I know what happened to your men, but I fail to see how I should be blamed for it.
I don't see what concern that is of yours.
I'm... looking for something. 
Little in life is fair, dwarf. Consider this just one example.
We have common cause. Can you not accept that?
I've a mind to travel south, after this. See that forest of yours for myself.
Flame purifies all.
Did you hit any of them, Kruber?
I'll not have you mock me, zealot!
Do not let your concerns distract you, Sergeant. This is for the Empire. 
Can't think how you keep missing it. Not exactly subtle architecture. Lost Hold, indeed.
Hmm... you have a keen eye, Grimgi. We obviously know where we are with each other. 
If I had kept my mouth shut like the rest of them, I'd made Captain a long ago. 
A fine example of how it's done.
Only if anyone knew, and my Order does not encourage sharing knowledge. That way leads to temptation.
I thought the brute would never die!
�If�, Sergeant.
Have a care, elf, or I'll...
I'm hungry.
You are probably right about Saltzpyre. He didn't come here because of you. 
He says he doesn't trust magery, but I think he's uncomfortable around women - unless they're bowing and scraping in abject fear, of course.
Fall! Brute! Fall!
I wouldn't expect an elf to understand.
I've heard that one before. In an Altdorf tavern. The singer was drunk.
Alright, alright, I'll tell you when I find it. Maybe. 
Watch your step, Kruber. Need is fleeting, but zeal never tires.
Careful with those bombs, Saltzpyre - we can't afford to waste them.
The jig is up, Elf. 
I'll wager good coin that there's an ambush ahead.
I presume your incessant grumbling has to do with your reason for being here? 
Now is as good time as any, Saltzpyre. Let's hear that tale. 
You've fought the skaven before, haven't you, Goreksson?
I'm not so sure. He did little to protect Ubersreik.
That can't be true. I'd have heard, there'd be uproar!
Could you teach me to shoot like that, elf?
This is a waste of time.
Like I said, nothing personal.
It was well struck, all the same.
But is corruption not just another name for weakness? Surely it is better to preach strength, than instil fear?
Normally, I like being underground, but this place? It sets my nerves on edge.
We march like thunder on the hills, to right the wrongs of old...
No.
False? Your barbarian god-king is nothing compared to the pantheon of heaven.
I've rarely strayed beyond the Empire. I suppose it's too late now.
*sigh* Only to you, Saltzpyre. Only to you.
Your soul howls in a darkness of your own making.
What you feel, Goreksson, is that pint of Estalian Brandy you drank earlier.
Damn Antique Shop, just my luck the Thagorakki had it burned.
Leave it be. There's nothing we could've done once the plague took hold.
Aqshy gutters like a windblown candle, but Shyish gusts strong. Death is rising.
Magic blows strong through here. There are voices scratching at my mind.
Right... I'm happy to take him at his word.
There is something going on with you, Elf.
Aye - blood and bone makes for good root-mulch.
It's not your steel they fear, but your breath.
What is it that you call our Ranger... the Hold-seeker?
But I've seen you...
I can put an arrow in your leg, One-Eye? It might help you stay in the moment?
This place stinks of evil magic.
Not bad, Azumgi. Not as good as Cousin Okri, but it's a start.
And you came back here?
I....  I don't know what you are talking about.
Something else, like...  one of us?
I have never seen, or even heard of, something like it before. What you suffer...  It's some form of curse, isn't it?
Maybe I was aiming for you!
And if you had yours, recklessness would be the only law!
Because I need your help, Sergeant. And because there is worse than temptation ahead of us.
Hah! You elves revel in deceit and mystery.
Magic is a crutch for weak minds.
Saltzpyre believes it marks me as Chaos-spawn.
I don't understand your fear of magic, One-Eye.
Kruber, you don't like me very much do, you?
You think I'm carting skaven tails around with me? Disgusting.
Aye, one or two. L�wenhof was my favourite. Strong ale. Trusting folk. Heavy purses.
Then hold tight to your moorings, and have a care not to be swept away.
These are dark days, but at least Sylvania is caged.
I have walked kingdoms you have no name for, through realms of dream and nightmare.
What if he's right? Some days I feel stranded on a sea of magic, one that grows tempestuous with my anger.
And you're determined to go where the next clue leads, wherever it may be?
I only know that they need to die. No secrets there One-Eye.
What of it?
If you are so interested in the Skaven, why not talk to a Rat-catcher?
Great heroes, manling, who fought back to back against the greenskins! 
I hate this filthy city.
These sewers will be thick with their nests. It's a rare city whose roots go ungnawed.
He means that you're thirsty, more than hungry, so fret not,  you'll have your ale soon enough.
I'll sing something else, shall I?
I do. If the Dark Gods don't end you, your own foolishness is sure to do so.
I bet losing that eye is a tale worth telling, manling!
Common enough. My family is originally from Talabecland, so thats where that came from. 
Elf, do not hold out on me. Share your knowledge of the Skaven.
Indeed. It was, how do you say, a heartwarming experience.
The geist-haunted lair is sealed? But how?
You know the whereabouts of an Antique Shoppe, perhaps near the Marktplatz?
I served in Ostland, got transferred from Reikland.
Lohner's words ring of truth, the ratmen have the town surrounded.  One wouldn't make it far alone. 
The trouble is, ice thaws, and the fires of damnation are raging.
What are you talking about, Dwarf?
They have seen much. More than they should, perhaps.
The abomination falls.
But you want to know why I am here, Sergeant? 
You're a reasonable man, Sergeant.
Only that you'll prove me correct. And that I do not die easily.
It's better that way. When all hands are against you, the way forward is clear.
Want me to throw the next one at you?
Perhaps it is past time our realms stood as one with the humans.
Do you know how Bretonnia fares?
What are you betting with, anyway? You keep telling us you've no more coin.
You believe her?
One-Eye didn't care much for your family.
I was in Tilea once - this was ages ago now - and they always talked of the ratmen as a curse. I should've listened.
Aye, but could I trust your answer?
Rat-men plague got them all. I'll grieve later. 
Knowledge is a weapon in righteous hands. I pride myself that I wield it well.
I know you want to check on your family's farm. Consider them dead, focus on revenge instead. 
So are you, Wizard.
There is a time to everything, Kruber. Nothing lasts forever.
Something stirs with every rat-man you kill. I've started to sense it.   
Rats everywhere. I'm sick of bloody rats.
It's never too late to choose a new path, Kruber.
Ah, hear the famous dwarf optimism. No wonder you lost an empire.
I've fought my share of battles against the beastmen of the woods, but these ratmen are different.
Aye, a good deal of them. And I might be mad, but not for the reasons they claim.
I yield to your experience, mercenary.
He deserved it. Good riddance.
The world.
The true moon is an aspect of Lileath. This was created in mockery of her.
Mm - yes. You have earned my trust, Dwarf. Don't make me regret it. 
What?
So now you need me, Saltzpyre?
Goreksson, what if the Hold you're seeking is nothing more than a myth, after all?
You are fortunate in your quest, Gorreksson.
Missed? Really? I suppose you're going to blame your short arms?
We'll make the Thaggoraki pay, Kruber.
Well, It wasn't me, if that's what you're asking.
Indeed it is! A fine tale of grudges settled, and foemen lying like firewood on the mountainside.
Is it my fault that Olesya's a devil at cards? She cheats, I swear.
It's a rare time that it's not, but they'll pull through. The ice of Kislev does not crack.
Oi!
Good job burning the hell out of those rats, keep it up.
Consider this your trial by combat. Have a care that you fight on the correct side.
Hah! One-Eye throws better!
Not bad, Wizard, Not bad.
eh, right.
I wouldn't dream of delegating such an inspiring task.  And don't mock the Sergeant's sense of duty.
So, the old location of the Red Moon Inn was somewhere around here? 
So, your kin, they all think you're mad, or somethin'? 
Really? I feel the same about faith.
I admire your dedication, Saltzpyre, if not your manner.
Weave forgive me, for letting this evil take root.
*angry spluttering*
Zharrin, you could have melted those shackles whenever you wanted, am I right?
*laughs* Master Dwarf, you'll turn my head.
You see? That's fine axe-work, even if I do say so myself.
For what it's worth, yes, I think so.
I think he volunteered. Maybe he likes me, after all?
Distrust requires doubt. Saltzpyre trades only in certainties - even when they're wrong.
They kept you though? 
Well, there's no sense being miserable, is there, Azumgi? Just because we're going to our deaths.
Perhaps darkness is all that remains to us?
Aye, well I've not had enough to drink - that's the trouble.
Have a care, Wutelgi. I had ancestors die at Pine Crags.
Ah, but which is that? Verminous anarchy on the one hand, hidebound law on the other.
It's all grim business these days.
No, but I do, Elf. 
I confess to some small confusion.
It is more than that. Can you not see that it's larger this night?
Actually, I find fire an excellent equaliser. Ashes seldom quibble.
Blindness is about more than sight. Fear closed his mind long ago.
Sigmar's light will come again, if we are worthy of it.
I shall endeavour to remember.
When my every conjuration all but sets your breath alight, then it's my concern.
I'm impressed, Grimgi. I've been fighting Skaven most of my life, but you almost know more about them than I do.
Kerillian, about your purpose here...
And yet you spend so much time at my side. There's no shame in admitting that you love me.
You have wanderlust then? Your purpose is to travel?
I wouldn't expect you to. Your mind is like a locked box, sealed with words learned by rote.
It doesn't matter. We should press on.
I can't argue. Did you hear of Shallya's temple in Altdorf?
I'm not sure I see it. You've travelled to many of them.
I used to. Then I realised that men are the same the world over.
I recall a mention of elves.
She means yes, I think.
I can only agree, Sergeant 
A right cheery one you are tonight, Zharrin.
What now, One-Eye? 
Neither did I, Wizard.
Keep your arm straight if you want to hit anything, wizard!
How about a friendly contest? He or she who collects the most tails, wins!
Why so interested, Hold-Seeker?
You seem to know these streets, Azumgi?
Guess I'm letting my guard down. Sorry, won't happen again. 
It crossed my mind.
You're in good spirits, Gorreksson.
Guess I'll just have to ask the Elf then. 
How much did you drink, dwarf?
What do you mean?
My kind have been trying for millennia, and I bet the elf's lot have been at it even longer.
Then we shall cleanse it, Goreksson, you and I.
It does sound a little.. sketchy. I mean, a lost Dwarf hold. How do you lose a whole bloody hold? Heard they're enormous. 
I guess not. 
Even our cities are not our own. How long have these vermin been gnawing at us?
Be more careful, Goreksson. Any further off course, and we'd all be dead.
You 'demand'?  
Don't weary our ears with this talk of false gods.
It's alright, Grimgi, I'll help you along.
Hold your tongue, witch. I don't wish to hear your heresies.
You have reasons for leaving your kin that you do not speak of, which is noteworthy, considering how much you talk.
Then why cling to prejudice and fears?
The warherds are always driven by their bestial nature. They fight hard, but direct. The ratmen are cunning, clever.
Wealthy merchant, a daughter, a Vampire in a warpstone mine, then add Skaven, blood and violence. There you have it. 
Have a care, lest the slaughter doesn't end with dead rats.
All the time.
If you mean no, dwarf, just say so.
Of course I'm right.
I suppose you had a good reason for allowing One-Eye to shackle you, and not burn him to a crisp?
You've encountered the Order before?
We've hardly time for me to tell you everything I know that you don't, have we?
Aye, well... Elves are somewhat present in the tale.
Why not? You might hit the thaggoraki then!
And some questions are best left unanswered, Sergeant
I suppose.
These are evil times.
Fine? You've almost cut him to pieces.
Try position and influence, and he's not the worst superior I've served. You're bloody clueless sometimes, you know that?
I know what you're saying, Zharrin. I can't go back home yet. 
Concerns, sir?
There's a knack to those things, Saltzpyre. Watch me, next time I throw.
Ah, you're a bit of a handful. aren't ya? 
Not capable? You think I summon these flames with some hidden tinderbox, Waywatcher?
Now that I've seen what your capable of, I understand why Saltzpyre wanted to escort you personally.
Neither did you. 
One monster to kill another, One-Eye?
No *laugh*.  
You're free to leave whenever you want, elf.
That's it! Put up your blade, wazzok!
There's something about him and the rat-men. The weave reacts. 
Wutelgi, do I have to ask our Wizard to get a straight answer?
So, this business of yours. anything I can help you with?
One-Eye is not wrong to fear the Dark Gods. These vermin are the least of their agents.
Then why don't you?
They don't believe me. They think I'm tricking them into a confession.
Sounds like a cheerful ballad.
This awful city... 
If we had a decade of uninterrupted practice? No. Not even then.
Couldn't be much worse.
Someone with a bad sense of humour, Hold-Seeker?
It's just Morrsleib, it comes and goes with the seasons.
Free to leave, but not free to return.
Denying us, the fighting men, any knowledge about the magic we'll face on the battle field, sending us in totally unprepared. That's a crime if anything. 
I've come to realise something. 
Bardin, these are dark times, and the Dwarfs I know are... 
What do you mean? 
You can't blame yourself. How were you to know that this was one Tilean tale you should have believed?
Don't mock me, elf!
I don't get it, Sir. You're an Empire official - who speaks freely of the rat-men. 
His axe shone silver in the dark, his brow was wrathful bold...
Heh, so he claims, but I have unattended business here, anyway. 
Such needless suspicion. No wonder your Empire falls into decay.
Not one? Saltzpyre? Not a single one?
Sergeant, you're staring.
Too long. Hold fast, Kruber. We'll strike a blow here, I promise you that.
You will be judged, witch, have no doubt.
You sure?
Such a poor sense of humour. Matches your eyesight.
I need your flames! There are vermin to burn.
A rare miss, dwarf.
There is no absolution for what you are. Be grateful for this small mercy.
Of course I talk to Bardin. The Dwarfs are a valuable ally and a fine soure of information regarding this matter. 
If it came down to it, I doubt you'd have the guts to face me. One-Eye. You'd set your dog on me, instead. 
This is a bleak place. It stinks of ruin and the collapse of empires.
Yeah, against an army of monsters that's not even supposed to exist. 
That's no surprise. I'm amazed you had the sense to remove them.
Do not listen to One-Eye, pyromancer. Yours is a gift that should be embraced, not feared.
It is only because Sigmar teaches us to respect the Dwarfs, that I even consider to indulge you.
Watch the rakogri burn! A magnificent sight!
Kruber, if my trial was now, and if you'd be allowed to have your say... 
Who will provide them? The dead or the rats?
Much the same as it is here. It's filthy, and ruled by fools.
Magic will not solve all your problems, witch.
They have a plan.
*growl*
I am like the wind on the fields. To cage me is to rob me of purpose.
Foolish mayflies.
All that slander of your superiors had me worried for awhile. Futility of war, was it?
My uncle's house is a smoking ruin.
Hehe, you don't miss it then?
And here I was, thinking we were mates now.
So we're allies now, Saltzpyre? I thought I was due a trial.
Tell me you feel it? The Weave shudders. I fear what comes next.
You missed! Do you earn much money as a professional soldier?
How my heart quails at the thought.
Or possibly your singing.
My purpose is to choose my purpose. A cage grants only a single, stale path.
There's still something you're not telling us, isn't there, elf?
Dwarf and Elf, fighting Thaggoraki in a Manling town, who would have thought?
It's hardly my concern if two groups of mayflies fall to brawling with one another.
Yes, your family. Are you still thinking about heading for their farm?
You mean the Burgomeister?
Don't trust me yet, Saltzpyre?
It doesn't bloody feel like it sometimes.
Careful Sergeant, It's almost like you're getting used to me 
That's not for me to say, but your eyes are harder than I'd have reckoned on.
Yeah, the question has crossed my mind.
Karak Zorn is as real as my beard, trust me on that. 
*snarl of irritation*
You could always ask me, dwarf. Maybe I know where it lies.
One of the Silent Sisters went insane - gutted and ate her fellows. Scrawled dark runes in their blood.
Don't mock. She is tied closer to the world than we will ever be.
Shame to see the city so forlorn. There's a charm to these human settlements.
Enough! Both of you!
You're less secretive than others of your kind, Saltzpyre
Sergeant, you do realize there's a diffence between fire magic and necromancy?
No you're not.
I think you did it. You burned that fat tyrant.
Who's she talking to?
 If I truly thought it was my face that bothered you, I'd wear a hood.
My condoleances, Kruber.
That's it exactly - they have a plan.
Perhaps both are right. Gifts can spring from many sources, not all of them wholesome.
I promised no such thing!
Sienna, I didn't expect your kind to be capable of .. seeing what you saw.
Hah! Among my kin, It's mostly wrong as always, Bardin
Order business is not your business, Kruber. And you should thank the comet for that. 
*laughs* You sure know how to take the joy out of a conversation, Hold-seeker.
Whatever your nefarious purpose, 'tis only a matter of time until I learn of it.  And colluding with the Fire Witch will only make matters worse.
I suppose it's cause you know I'll win
Oh, really? During the ambush, or when the dwarfs threw down their weapons and begged for mercy?
You're never tempted to let it keep burning?
I daresay it thinks little of you, elf.
You know, I think the elf's right.
Aye, grew up on a farm not far from here. 
I'll not take that bet, Azumgi, not the way our luck's been going.
You know why I stick around, only fair I know the same about you.
If we survive this, I'll have runesmith cast you a sword of good mountain steel.
Sienna, you think we can we trust Kerillian?
It gives Saltzpyre certainty. I prefer to trust, until someone wrongs me.
I'll tell tales when all the Vermin are dead, Dwarf. Onwards! 
I don't wish to speak of it.
I'm a bladesman by trade, not a bombardier.
Didn't you catch a Stormvermin, awhile back? 
A fine night for slaughter, eh, dawri?
Yeah, Engelbrecht's Curiosities, on Kugelstrasse. If it's still standing. 
Goreksson, care to enlighten us on what it is you seek,exactly?
Filthy thing. I never want to touch one again.
You walk a righteous path for the moment, but that will change.
You are far from home, Kerillian
Well, we can't all be elves, can we?
If I wanted you dead, One-Eye, you'd be been wormfood long ago.
Seems we're all sticking around so far. Guess we all have our reasons. 
If your masters had their way, we'd all dwell in squalor.
Can we defeat them? Once and for all, I mean?
Why does One-Eye hate you so? I've known dwarfs less single-minded.
Do not betray my trust, witch. Your shackles can easily be restored.
We'll not see such a day. We cultivate distrust as a farmer cultivates his crops.
I'm warning you, Wutelgi...
So, how come are we blessed with your company, Master Goreksson?
A momentary lapse. Nothing more.
Shoddy human umgak. Showing me up in front of the elf.
I give it life, then I smother the blaze before it runs wild.
Talk about a dramatic turn of events. 
Mmh, you mean first guard and prisoner, then you and I fighting on the same side?
Coin is the reason you allow him to push you around?
I think I know my own stomach, thank you, Kruber.
Thought he was looner first. Well... still do, but.. 
Yes, Zharrin, wherever it may be! 
I have no idea who they are.
There is no evil magic. Just the cause to which it is put. Magic is much like faith, that way.
He hired me. 
You should not let One-Eye worry you so, pyromancer. His is a small mind.
At last, we agree on something, witch.
Should I be honoured to be the source of your quandary?
No one's asking you to eat them, Kruber. Just kill them.
*lies* I saw one limp away.
I confess, I didn't think that would bring it down, Grimgi.
We've only caught the scum of their kind. No leaders, only mindless drones. 
Cousin Okri reckons that rat tastes like rotten chicken.
Never will.. A witch wears many faces, some seem more honourable than others.
Sigmar protects us.
This is a right old mess, and no mistake. I should make for the hills, find my kin.
You see that? Right in the rakogri's eye!
Watch it, you two. I don't like where this conversation is going. 
Better be quick about it, hold-seeker. The days are growing dark.
Well struck, Azumgi! We're like Hrothi and Balgor at Karaz a Karak!
Saltzpyre believes it marks me as Chaos-spawn.
You haven't asked me to join the game. I know you keep count of your kills.
Truly? That's not what I hear.
This is a grim business, dawri.
Ubersreik is my home, and you bloody well know I'll fight for it. 
Kruber, why do you follow One-Eye?
I have decided that you shall not face trial. Not yet.
Still you pester the rest of us. We don't know more than you do, just accept it. 
No, not at the moment. Dwarf matters.
Friendship takes time, azumgi. Let it steep awhile.
The next one'll be better, Azumgi!
Its knights fight amongst themselves, they quarrel over which undead king should rule.
Why do you call it false?
Killing the rat-men draws magic to her. It serves some purpose. I haven't seen what happens when she kills something else, though.
It was a lucky shot, that's all.
Let us hope they sing better than you, then, hold-seeker.
And do I disappoint? You were expecting something more otherworldly? Of shimmering lights and soothing song?
Valaya's Chalice! That takes some skill, missing them all.
You're not the first Elf to threaten me, and those who did, paid for it dearly. Remember that, Elf.
Don't bloody miss, then, Grimgi!
Can't say I trust magic, but I don't hate it like Grimgi does.
What's with the Ostland colours, Azumgi?
One less monster in the world.
I guess the rest of us don't know Goreksson as well as you do. Which is a bit of surprise.
Think we all saw it in your eyes, for a short while there.
I think our elf finally found herself a challenge.
*loud sigh* I'm no storyteller, Dwarf!
Not at all. Just know that I am on to you. 
I had a cousin who throws like that. We don't trust him with an axe.
Another of the Order?
Once, this land belonged to my kind. It will do so again.
He's been right about a lot of things lately. More than I care for.
You know why I'm in this bloody town, Wutelgi. To share your purpose is only fair.
The Empire will never fall.
A god of wilderness? What does he know of forging weapons?
Aye, but it makes for a lonely road without comrades, Grimgi.
No, no, Kruber. I need a rat-man of much higher rank. Something far more sinister. 
Some wizard's trick, I hear. The Supreme Patriarch himself. I doubt it'll last.
You think humanity is doomed?
Stout heart *and* stout aim! You make me proud, Azumgi!
No. One of my kind. She too was convinced that she did holy work, and measured her success in blood.
Defied by technology, elf?
The rat-men just keep coming, and it won't end soon, so how about that tale about your eye that you promised me? 
Since you're so eager to learn about the Skaven, why don't you ask Bardin? 
Do tell.
The false moon watches us like an evil eye.
Saltzpyre seems to have a special interest in the rat-men
Time for what, Ranger?
Where's the skill you keep boasting of, elf?
Ah, good point, Zharrin. I shall endeavour to not exhale. 
Now is as good time as any, Saltzpyre.
That almost sounded like a compliment, Saltzpyre.
Surprised, One-Eye?
Amongst my people, magic is considered a gift.
You missed all of them, dwarf. That takes a special talent.
Ah, that's just the elf complaining. Ignore her - that's what I do.
Aye, well. He wouldn't hold still, would he?
I think there is more to it than a simple hold hunt, Goreksson.
The fire isn't something I control.
Which I wouldn't, Wizard.
Yes.
How do you know?
Will this darkness never end? Even my fires do little to penetrate it.
Now I think of it, I'm sure I was at Karak Zorn, not - oh - five decades ago.
I'm honestly trying not to, Wizard.  
That moon bodes ill for us all.
I'm saying, Zharrin, that's it's too early to tell. Not all labours can be accomplished in a lifetime.
It was more... gambling. I have a knack for it. 
I think our elf ate something that doesn't agree with her.
Kruber has a soldier's instinct, right enough.
Quiet, hold-seeker.
A warming fire is a good friend in dark times, Zharrin. As are you.
A fine excuse for inaction. Gods should care more about their folk.
Well, I wanted action.
Of course, as they were dwarfs, one was probably drunk, and the other there by accident.
Such compliments, hunter. You'll turn my head.
Much as I'm glad you set me free, I think I'd prefer a nice, quiet cell.
No expulcation, just a reprieve?
And then you hack his legs off?
You'd turn away a helping hand, even amongst this?
*snort* Your burden of proof shifts with the wind, and smells of dung.
*snarl of irritation*
Didn't take long for your fighting spirit to return, Kruber
No game, and unless you be quiet, no Dwarf.
Do not listen to One-Eye, pyromancer. Yours is a gift that should be embraced, not feared.
Nothing wrong with that. The Doom of Broggi Stonehand's a fine song to go with an ale or twelve.
And you'd be welcome.
If your squawking wasn't so distracting...
Let her be, sir. She revels in her mysteries. Perhaps it's to hide a lack of substance.
You are currently within the borders of the Empire of Sigmar, and therefore under my scrutiny and jurisdiction. 
Good! No one ever sings about uneventful days, and I'd like my kin to sing of my deeds.
Not so clever with real weapons, witch?
So you robbed them? Ah, there may be hope for you yet!
You speak like there's skill to that clumsy weapon. Point and loose, that's all it is.
Did you heard that the old Red Moon Inn was here round the Docks? It burnt down to the ground. 
These are strange times. 
That'll have them running in hear, and no mistake!
